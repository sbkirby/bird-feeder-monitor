# Bird Feeder Monitor
![Bird Feeder Monitor](https://github.com/sbkirby/bird-feeder-monitor/blob/master/images/main-bird-feeder-image.jpg) 

This is a project to monitor the number of birds that visit my bird feeder, as well as record the amount of time spent feeding. I used an Arduino YÃºn and a capacitive touch sensor, Adafruit CAP1188, to detect and record the birds feeding. On a routine basis, the accumulated data is sent to a Google Docs spreadsheet to record the number and time spent by the birds visiting the feeder.

Data is only transmitted during a set period of time prior to sunrise and after sunset.
